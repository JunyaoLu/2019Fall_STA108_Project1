# 2019Fall STA108 Project1

This is a project that Fengshuo Song and I worked on together for the class STA108 in the Fall Quarter 2019.

We were trying to find out whether there is a significant positive linear relationship between the price and the living square footage for houses sold in King County, Washington in a particular year. We built a regression model to help predict sale prices based on the living square footage of the houses. Based on the 500 sets of randomly selected data, we built a linear regression model. In this report, we utilized multiple approaches with the use of Rstudio, including scatterplots, histograms, normal Q-Q plots, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests and so on.
